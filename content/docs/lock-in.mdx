title: Lock In
---

I usually put [this](https://open.spotify.com/track/2dlWl0aLvdQ64L2ONG0O5y) on. Or any song by [Nils](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5gqhueRUZEa7VDnQt4HODp) really. And work.

I personally have a system of [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) & [Linear](https://linear.app) that show me top tasks I should work on. I just do each task one by one (current task is shown in top right corner with [NotchBar](https://github.com/navtoj/notchbar) so I can't get distracted).

I still have issues with managing use of social media like X, IG as there is no robust system in place for this. I will build it eventually. Although on iOS it's bit more tricky.
