## 10

Had a little breakdown due to some consecutive fails & decided to [write about it here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/nikiv/blob/0e6dbae16ec4465023305911bf784fdf0a0c84ff/content/docs/looking-back/25-october.mdx).

I have since removed it. There is a hard rule I want to set & obide by and that is no complaining. I did write about my dog Rachel in there and how ever since Rachel's death, the pressure of time passing is always with me.

I will write about it in some more detail when things are more stable in my life.

But for now, I have to **ruthlessly focus** and **cut all noise**. Down to the second.

I updated my [habits](/habits). They are a good set and contain a lot in them. It will take a while to get a handle on them. Especially the ones relating to exercise & no sugar will be tough. But there is also taking daily handle on my skin, drinking smoothies etc.

It's a lot of things I really need tuned. But more importantly, the failures I did have, don't bother me any more. There is a beatiful thing where I know that the future I am going towards is possible. It's annoying that no one supports it financially but that time will come.

The only rule is to never complain and simply learn from the failures so as not to repeat them again.

Another thing I learned these past months is that vibe coding or vibe engineering is fun but it can't handle more complex products. You have to know the code and the abstractions.

Fairly soon this will change and I see it changing rapidly especially with codex but that future is not yet here so have to be a lot more wise in the decisions made and code written.

But less so the code, what matters most is literally solving the **most impactful problems** right now.

I got distracted building a game platform as there was some interest and investment shown towards it in August but it turned out to be too difficult to build.

From now on, no mistakes like this. I say no a lot more often. And I focus on solving real problems with real fucking impact.

And I automate my workflow to bits. Everything has to be tracked. Every distraction has to be blocked at software level. Everything has to be tuned and automated as much as possible.

I want by the end of 2025 to reach a state where there are always tokens being generated to solve the problems I have or I am solving towards, I just need to review the work and do certain fine tuned changes.

All software and everything I build from now on is going to move towards this. I know there are teams, most likely in SF that already operate at this level but that's not me yet and I need to reach that state soon.

I am not in SF and I can't go to SF as I don't have the funds yet. I can't even afford my own coffee or rent yet. But I will get there asap.

The future being here but not being evenly distributed is too true and it's a shame. But nothing to be sad over. If there is an internet connection, a keyboard (ideally [mac's](/config)), you can literlly build anything and do it **fast**.

Anyway, it's nice to remove all that massive complaining I wrote in this journal and get to work. No one owes me anything and the success only comes from actually building, showing real value & actually putting a fucking price tag on it.

I did too many things open source in my life. I am 30 now with like 0$ on my account but a bunch of repos with GitHub stars. It's a joke.

I know open source is the most optimal way to do software and I will do open source but I am super pragmatic now with how things will be done.

1focus.ai, solbond.co will be super succesful and I know it. I have a certain team that are insane engineers that I met. Also designer that it's just inevitable at this point.

But you still have to write the code, iron out all the quirks. Fix all the bugs and make sure no bugs ever linger in production. And it has to be fast.

I want to build Telegram/OpenAI level software for literally all aspects of life. No compromise.

I also should write more about my workflow soon because it gotten soo good that people just don't understand what is actually possible with Karabiner, macOS and a little bit of creativity and prompting.

Actually insane is what's possible.

Completely done with that little side quest of doing game platform & fully doing 1focus.ai now.

It's exciting but so tiring. Working with codex is super nice though. I invest heavily into optimizing my workflow so I can move faster though given what this new medium unlocks.

1focus itself will massively accelerate this. Should have paid version of 1focus out asap so we can hire a team & move much much faster.

Also [blade](https://blade.im) is genuinely cool. It & [Jazz](https://jazz.tools) is what I plan to build literally all my software with. As far as state goes. Blade does rendering too though.

I also am moving to Limassol, Cyprus from November.

I can't wait to move much much faster. All of what happened in the past, is literally gone. I learned a lot. Every second counts now. Everything I do has maximum value.

Everything I do will have a price tag attached to it from now on and be stable. No more charity stuff. Just ruthless working towards one goal and that's to build delightful software that makes a difference. Sustainably.

[I'll still call](https://open.spotify.com/track/1SerYv7SabsGxVl0qIKES9) is such a good song.
