## January 7

2025 is exciting year. It is also the year I set out to do weekly public logs which look like this in [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things) as recurring task.

I also [published this new docs/wiki site](https://x.com/nikivdev/status/1876279218763674056) this month with [FumaDocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/).

[Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net) is big inspiration in how much and how he shares his work/learnings. And [brandur](https://brandur.org) is big inspiration for how to do long form writing well.

Aside from the weekly recurring task and my optimized [habits](/habits), I also plan to do a monthly overview which is also a recurring task.

It's goal is to just overview quickly what happened over the month and do a cleanup (finances, apps, etc.). A kind of cleanse to cut the waste going into the month. Will be a more refined process with time.

I took a break from journalling in 2023 due to [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev) build issues so nice to be back.

Tried to make sense of [OpenAuth](https://openauth.js.org) & [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com) as I try to move away from using [Clerk](https://clerk.com) for all things auth.
