title: Sharing
---

I mostly only share things on [X](https://x.com/nikivdev) (posts of all kind), [IG](https://instagram.com/nikiv.dev) (photos, reels) & [GitHub](https://github.com/nikivdev) (code).

I sometimes reply/post on [Reddit](https://reddit.com/user/nikivi) (random communities), share songs on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/nikitavoloboev) ([Nils](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5gqhueRUZEa7VDnQt4HODp) is top).

I also am trying to get my [Telegram](https://t.me/nikivdev) more active.

Other places I do share things in from most active to less are:

- [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nikivi) (tech stuff & things)
- [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/~nikivi) (tech stuff)
- [Glass](https://glass.photo/nikiv) (more secluded photographer community)
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@nikivdev) (once I learn to make proper videos, will start sharing more)
- [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/nikivi) (I love movies)
- [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/users/nikiv) (good for series but I forget to track things often there, need to automate)
- [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/nikiv.dev) (don't really use but love the [open social concept](https://overreacted.io/open-social/))
- [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/nikiv) (interesting ideas, like decentralized X with crypto)
- [Cosmos](https://cosmos.so/nikiv) (nice image gallery community)
- [Threads](https://threads.net/@nikiv.dev) (love the design but forget to cross post things there)
- [Mastodon](https://merveilles.town/@nikivi) (part of nice server there but also don't often visit or post there)
- [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@nikivdev) (mostly just watch things there but rarely post, should probably do)
- [Pinterest](https://pinterest.com/nikivdev) (rarely open or post there)
- [VSCO](https://vsco.co/nikivdev/gallery) (use it rarely to edit photos, rarely post too)
- [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/nikivdev) (rarely post sounds)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/nikitavoloboev) (once we are profitable or get funding, will share more things there)
- [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/nikivdev) (going to start streaming very very soon)
- [Substack](https://substack.com/@nikivi) (will cross post my articles there)
- [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com/nikivdev) (rarely update as I don't have attention span to read books now)
- [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/nikivi) (like an occasional chess game)
