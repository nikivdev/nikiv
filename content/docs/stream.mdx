title: Stream
---

Plan to start streaming building projects soon. Need to setup OBS and actually stable working place. I did not have this for whole of 2025. But maybe soon will.

My old streams can be found [here](https://youtube.com/@nikivdev/streams) (if you can call them streams). I dislike how you can't attach music I was listening to at the time due to copyright.

I have idea for how to solve this in my own streaming platform I want to build eventually but till then will probably just stream things on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@nikivdev)/[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/nikivdev) and call it a day. Telegram allows streaming too which is nice.
