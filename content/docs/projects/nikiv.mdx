Evolving this personal site, trying to make it better.

Code is [here](https://github.com/nikivdev/nikiv). I have `:` + `space` open [Reflect](https://reflect.app) & `caps_lock` + `k` to open cursor workspace with `nikiv.dev` folder + my wiki and internal site (where I do post drafts).

How it's setup:

And how it looks often when I open it (I often keep sidebar hidden & sometimes use codex in terminal to do research into `wiki` folder).
