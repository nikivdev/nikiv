I [learn](/learn), [journal](/looking-back) & [code](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev) [projects](/focus) using [lovely tools](/workflow).

I [share](/sharing) thoughts on [X](https://x.com/nikitavoloboev) (DMs welcome, reach out), photos on [IG](https://instagram.com/nikiv.dev), songs on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/nikitavoloboev), videos on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/nikitavoloboev).

This [open source](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/nikiv) site is a place where I keep all my notes and things (older version [here](https://wiki.nikiv.dev)).

I do mostly private notes for now (until [LA](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) is built) but some can be seen [here](/notes).

Always happy to answer [questions](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/ama).
