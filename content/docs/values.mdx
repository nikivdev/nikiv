- Never kill an animal or eat some animal's meat (as I can't know the conditions it lived its life, most often its [horrendous](https://youtube.com/watch?v=8gqwpfEcBjI))
- Support animal welfare in any way I can (i.e. by [donating to organizations](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kWcPg8t1kJ4))
- Be compassionate to others, try see their point of view always
